                        WIZyWIG gets its name from the acronym "wysiwyg",
                        which is commonly pronounced as<br/>"wiz-ee-wig", and stands
                        for "What you see is what you get". It has become
                        synonymous with Rich Text Editors, and in technical circles
                        you'll often hear of a Rich Text Editor being referred to as
                        a "wysiwyg editor".<br /><br />
                        WIZyWIG was created with one goal in mind: to help you get
                        over your writer's block. With our colorful themes and adaptive
                        interface, you'll find your fingers flying across the keys
                        and reaching your typing goals in no time at all!<br /><br />
